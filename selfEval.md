# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
  - I still need to learn the terminology for all the comparison operators. Doing the exercises helped tremendously
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
  - I feel fairly confident, with more practice I will feel even better.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
  - The if statements still need some work. I know I can write them and comprehend what they are doing however, I don't feel fully confident in those abilities.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
  - This lesson took a little longer than I expected. I spent a couple hours on it and that exceeded my estimate.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  - I need to practice if statements and else statements. Tomorrow and Friday I allowed for extra study time so hopefully I shouldn't have to make changes to my schedule.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  - I still have questions on some of the code used in if and else statements. I will continue to google those questions and post my questions in slack.
